## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

#### 🙋‍♀️ A team tuple is a team that can develop freely without time restrictions!
#### 🌈 The core code is not publicly available, but you can freely contribute to the team tuple's public library or api server used for bots!
#### 👩‍💻 You can check the reference of the API server and the API of the bot at docs.teamtuple.me (WIP)!
#### 🍿 Most of the members of the team tuple are students with midterm and final exams.
