## Hi there 👋


#### 🙋‍♀️ Team tuple is a team that participants can develop freely without time restrictions!
#### 🌈 The core code is not publicly available, but you can freely contribute to the team tuple's public library or api server used for bots!
#### 👩‍💻 You can check out the reference of the API server and the API of the bot via docs.teamtuple.me (WIP)!
#### 🍿 Most of the members of the team tuple are students has important midterm and final exams, so we may not be able to work during exam seasons.

Thank You!
